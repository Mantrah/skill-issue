# Saudi Arabia acquires EA for $55 billion in largest LBO in history

**Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF has officially completed the acquisition of Electronic Arts for $55 billion, including $20 billion in debt. Shareholders approved the deal at 99%, with PIF owning 93% of the company.**

It's now official: Electronic Arts, publisher of FIFA (sorry, EA Sports FC), Battlefield, and The Sims, is now under Saudi ownership. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners (Jared Kushner's firm), has completed the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history. The announcement, made on September 29, 2025, was approved by 99% of shareholders in a vote on December 22.

"We are thrilled to welcome EA into our strategic investment portfolio," said Yasir Al-Rumayyan, PIF Governor, during a press conference in Riyadh. "Ultimate Team packs represent a sustainable and renewable business model that we deeply admire. It's digital oil." The executive also noted that the Saudi fund, which already owns Newcastle United and organizes LIV Golf tournaments, sees gaming as "the soft power of the 21st century".

The transaction nearly fell apart due to an administrative mix-up. According to our sources, several Saudi officials believed for three weeks they were acquiring "Energy Assets," a fictional oil company. "When they told us about EA and 'Ultimate Team,' we thought it was an elite drilling engineer squad," confides an advisor speaking on condition of anonymity. "We discovered the misunderstanding when we saw someone dressed as Cristiano Ronaldo in the boardroom."

Among gamers, reactions range from resignation to biting irony. On Reddit, the post announcing the acquisition has already garnered 450,000 upvotes, with a top comment reading: "At least now when EA says loot boxes provide a sense of pride and accomplishment, it'll technically be an official state motto." This references EA's infamous 2017 Reddit comment, which still holds the record for most downvoted comment in history (-667,000).

Jean-François, 28, a FIFA player since 2009, has a theory: "Honestly, nothing changes. EA was already draining our wallets with packs, now it's just more transparent. At least the Saudis openly admit they're here for the money." Another player, Maxime, 34, adds: "I calculated that I've spent €4,200 on Ultimate Team over the last seven years. Technically, I helped finance this buyout. I'm kind of proud."

Among EA developers, the mood is more tense. "They told us there would be no changes to creative direction," confides an employee at the Redwood Shores studio who wishes to remain anonymous. "But during the first video call with the new shareholders, someone suggested adding a 'Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca' mode in The Sims 5. We're still not sure if he was joking."

American senators are concerned about national security implications. "EA owns data on millions of American players," warns Senator Elizabeth Warren in a statement. "What happens when the Saudi kingdom discovers that 73% of Madden players can't tell a touchdown from a home run?" The question remains unanswered.

Dr. Philippe Manette, an economist specializing in video game business models, puts things in perspective: "The $55 billion LBO with $20 billion in debt is ambitious. But EA generates so much cash from Ultimate Team they could pay it back by selling 'Saudi Icons' packs with Yasser Al-Qahtani as a 99-rated card." He adds: "Honestly, between an American pension fund wanting dividends and a Saudi oil fund wanting dividends, the average player won't see the difference. Both just want us to buy more FIFA Points."

The transaction is expected to close in the first fiscal quarter of 2027, by June 2026, pending regulatory approvals. In the meantime, EA has announced a new Season Pass for EA Sports FC 26 at $79.99, with a "PIF Prestige" VIP tier at $299.99 that includes one guaranteed pack per week and a wallpaper featuring the Saudi flag.

Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO, concluded the press conference with these words: "Today marks the beginning of a new era for Electronic Arts. An era of growth, innovation, and responsible microtransactions." When asked to define "responsible microtransactions," he left the stage without answering.

Saudi Arabia clarified that it does not plan to acquire Ubisoft "for now," but is keeping "all options on the table if Assassin's Creed continues to underperform."
