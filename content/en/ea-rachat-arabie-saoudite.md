# Saudi Arabia Acquires EA for $55 Billion in Largest LBO in History

**A consortium led by Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF has announced the acquisition of Electronic Arts for $55 billion. According to our sources, investors allegedly mistook Ultimate Team packs for a strategic reserve of digital oil.**

It's official: Electronic Arts has changed hands. The Saudi Public Investment Fund, alongside Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and investment firm Silver Lake, announced Wednesday the acquisition of the California-based publisher for a record $55 billion, including $20 billion in debt. This marks the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) ever executed on Wall Street, surpassing the previous record held by the 2007 TXU Energy acquisition.

"After analyzing the revenue streams generated by FIFA Ultimate Team, we immediately understood we were dealing with a renewable natural resource," declared Mohammed bin Salman during the press conference. "Every year, millions of players spend billions on virtual cards that vanish after twelve months. It's the most brilliant economic model we've ever witnessed. Even oil eventually runs out."

The Crown Prince also announced that EA's infamous Reddit comment – "The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment" – would become the official motto of the new board of directors. As a reminder, this 2017 comment still holds the record for the most downvoted message in the platform's history, with over 667,000 negative votes, after EA attempted to justify Star Wars Battlefront II's progression system.

"This comment perfectly embodies our investment philosophy," clarified Jared Kushner. "Why sell a finished product when you can sell the sense of pride that comes from spending $2,000 to assemble a team that will be obsolete next September?" The consortium further announced that EA's microtransactions would now be classified as "national infrastructure investment" in the kingdom's accounts, alongside NEOM and The Line projects.

When questioned about rumors that PIF had initially believed they were acquiring an oil company upon seeing the "EA" acronym (Energy Assets), a spokesperson vehemently denied before abruptly hanging up. The first Saudi FC 25 players reported noticing no significant changes to the game's economic model, "which is reassuring in one sense, and terrifying in another."
