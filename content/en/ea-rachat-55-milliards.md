# Electronic Arts acquired for $55 billion by Saudi-led consortium

**EA shareholders approved the $55 billion buyout by a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Gamers discover you can also farm in real life.**

It's official as of December 22, 2025: Electronic Arts, gaming giant and inventor of the "pay to run faster in FIFA" concept, is becoming the property of a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. With 201 million votes in favor and only 1.9 million against, shareholders overwhelmingly approved this historic $55 billion transaction, making it the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.

"This is a tremendous moment for our industry," said Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO, during a press conference. "We share a common vision with PIF: creating experiences that provide a sense of accomplishment and pride for an additional payment." The consortium, which also includes Silver Lake Partners and Affinity Partners (Jared Kushner's investment firm), will pay $210 per share, a 25% premium over the pre-announcement stock price.

In gaming forums, the news sparked mixed reactions. "Honestly, I don't see the difference between paying €120 for the FIFA Ultimate Season Pass and funding a stadium in the desert," analyzes Kevin, 29, who has logged 2,400 hours on EA Sports FC 25. "At least now, when I rage-quit after losing to a full pay-to-win team, I can tell myself my money is financing infrastructure." His girlfriend Sophie, who thought he was talking about actual football until 2023, declined to comment.

According to Dr. Jean-Pierre Manette, an economist specializing in gaming acquisitions, this transaction could pave the way for new creative synergies. "Imagine: microtransactions in The Sims to buy real luxury clothing, or a Career Mode in Battlefield where you can literally invest in oil contracts. The possibilities are endless, just like the ways to spend money." The expert clarified he was paid $50,000 for this interview, "which is still cheaper than a competitive FUT team".

The deal is expected to close by June 2026, subject to regulatory approval. Meanwhile, EA has announced its next game: *Oil Tycoon Simulator*, where players can buy loot boxes containing virtual oil wells. The Season Pass is already available for pre-order at $89.99.
