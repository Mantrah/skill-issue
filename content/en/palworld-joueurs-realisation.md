# Palworld players realize they've just been catching creatures for 300 hours

**A strange phenomenon is shaking the Palworld community: thousands of players are suddenly becoming aware that they've spent hundreds of hours doing exactly what they did in Pokémon, but with guns.**

The collective epiphany struck this weekend, triggering a wave of confusion across social media. Players worldwide report having a brutal revelation mid-farming session: they're capturing creatures, making them fight, and optimizing their stats. Exactly like in Pokémon. But more violent.

Marc, 28, a web developer and dedicated player, describes the moment realization hit him: "I was min-maxing my fourth Lamball when I realized I was doing competitive breeding. I looked at my automated base where my Pals work 24/7 and it clicked. I'm just playing Pokémon Diamond with AK-47s and assumed animal exploitation." Marc didn't quit the game though. He just added "but it's different" to his Steam bio.

According to a study conducted by the Independent Institute of Compulsive Gaming, 89% of Palworld players have already played Pokémon, and 73% refuse to admit the similarity "on principle." "We're observing a fascinating psychological defense mechanism," explains Dr. Jean-Pierre Manette, specialist in video game cognitive dissonance. "Players know they're doing the same thing, but the addition of firearms creates a sufficient illusion of novelty to justify 300 additional hours of gameplay."

The phenomenon took an unexpected turn when a player, Kevin, 34, posted on Reddit: "Wait, you guys also capture cute things and make them fight? I thought I was the only one." The thread now has 47,000 comments from players sharing their moment of realization, some admitting they've "just replaced Charmander with a Foxparks carrying a shotgun."

Nintendo hasn't commented on the situation, settling for an enigmatic statement: "We observe with interest this phenomenon of players discovering the concept of creature capture for the first time in 2025." The Pokémon Company was more direct, simply publishing an image of Pikachu holding a sign reading "We warned you it was addictive."

Pocketpair studio, Palworld's developer, celebrated 25 million players by posting a tweet: "Thanks to all our trainers... uh, sorry, our Pal tamers!" before deleting it 3 minutes later.

An online petition asking Game Freak to add weapons to the next Pokémon has already collected 250,000 signatures, with the main argument being: "If we have to do the same thing again, Pikachu might as well have a Glock."
