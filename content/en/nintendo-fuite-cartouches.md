# Switch 2: Leak reveals new 128GB cartridges

**A third-party studio accidentally announced the arrival of new 128GB cartridges for the Nintendo Switch 2. The press release was deleted 4 minutes later. The community manager has not been heard from since.**

This is the year's biggest blunder in the gaming industry. A publisher, whose name has been carefully erased from all records, posted on social media a statement mentioning the possibility of releasing their game "in full physical version thanks to the new Switch 2 cartridges." Information that Nintendo had not yet officially announced.

Witnesses present in the studio's offices describe a scene of panic. "The intern hit publish instead of draft. We all heard a dull thud, like something breaking. It was his career," recounts an anonymous employee. The tweet was viewed 47,000 times before its deletion. Nintendo's legal team was allegedly alerted at the 12th second.

According to Jean-Claude Joycon, attorney specializing in NDA law at Iwata & Sons, the consequences are predictable. "Nintendo has a very clear policy regarding leaks: social, professional, and sometimes geographical disappearance. I've seen people rebuild their lives under a different name after tweeting a release date early." A source at Nintendo France confirms that "appropriate measures have been taken," without specifying whether or not this includes a lifetime ban from all company products.

The studio in question has since published a new statement claiming to have "never existed" and thanking Nintendo for "years of imaginary collaboration."
