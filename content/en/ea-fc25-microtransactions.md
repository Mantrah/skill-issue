# EA Sports FC 25: New Season Pass Sparks Controversy

**EA Sports FC 25's new paid seasonal pass is causing an uproar. An Electronic Arts representative assures that "the sense of pride and accomplishment is priceless, but we can still give you a price point".**

It's the culmination of an economic strategy perfected over 32 years: EA Sports FC 25 now offers a paid game, with microtransactions, and a paid seasonal pass. Belgian players still cannot purchase FC Points due to local legislation. The Belgian government has described this decision as "a public health measure, on par with vaccination".

Kévin, 23, calculated his Ultimate Team spending since 2018. The total amounts to €4,200. "I could have bought a real car. But would a real car have given me TOTY Mbappé? No." Kévin still lives with his parents. He insists that "it's a choice". His mother, reached for comment, hung up in tears.

According to Dr. Heinrich Lootbox, behavioral economist at the University of Las Vegas, EA's model is "a masterpiece of financial engineering". "They've managed to make people pay for the right to pay more. It's genius. Even casinos are taking notes." The study reveals that 78% of Ultimate Team players don't know the total amount of their purchases, and 94% prefer "not to know".

EA responded in a statement: "We offer players the freedom to choose how they want to progress. Slowly and for free, or quickly and at their own expense. That's democracy." The statement also specifies that Season 8's Season Pass will offer "even more content to unlock", including "the ability to watch goal replays without paying".

In South Korea, FC Points are also banned. The only two countries in the world where FIFA players still have positive bank balances.
