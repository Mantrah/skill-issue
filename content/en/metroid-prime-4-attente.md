# Metroid Prime 4 finally released after years of development

**As Nintendo finally announces the release of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on December 4th, thousands of gamers are realizing with horror everything that has happened in their lives since the game was announced. Some struggle to recognize their loved ones.**

It's an earthquake shaking the global gaming community. After 18 years of waiting, Nintendo has finally deigned to release Metroid Prime 4, triggering a wave of confusion among fans who had, in some cases, completely forgotten what their life looked like before the announcement.

Julien, 41, is one of these "waiting survivors." "I was 23 when I started waiting for this game. Today, there's a woman in my living room who claims to be my wife and two teenagers calling me 'dad'. I'm not quite sure how that happened," he confesses, dazed, standing in front of his still-wrapped Nintendo Switch 2. According to Dr. Marie-France Joystick, specialist in video game trauma at the University of Kyoto-on-Thames, this phenomenon affects "at least 340,000 gamers in France alone, of which 12% missed their own wedding because they were refreshing the Nintendo Direct page."

A study commissioned by the National Gaming Research Institute reveals that 67% of Metroid Prime fans have developed "chronic waiting syndrome," characterized by an inability to believe the game actually exists. "We have patients who refuse to launch the game, convinced it's a trap and that it will be delayed again as soon as they press Start," the report explains.

Nintendo responded with its usual tact by issuing a laconic statement: "We thank our fans for their patience. For those who passed away in the meantime, a tribute edition will be available for $79.99, funeral DLC not included." The Japanese company also specified that development of Metroid Prime 5 would begin "soon," immediately causing the hospitalization of 1,200 gamers for anxiety attacks.

Meanwhile, Half-Life 3 fans continue to stare into the void.
