# Assassin's Creed Shadows Receives Positive Reviews Despite Multiple Delays

*The game, released in March 2025 after three postponements, has finally received favorable reviews. Ubisoft's communications department has no idea how to handle good news.*

This is an unprecedented situation for Ubisoft: Assassin's Creed Shadows, released on March 20, 2025 after being delayed from November 2024 to February 2025, then to March 2025, has been well-received by critics with an 82% score on OpenCritic. At the Montreuil offices, nobody had prepared for this scenario.

"We had drafted three different apology statements," confides a press officer under condition of anonymity. "One for bugs, one for missing content, one for microtransactions. We had nothing ready for 'it works'." The Word document titled "Apologies_AC_Shadows_V4_FINAL_REALLY_FINAL.docx" reportedly went unused, a first since 2018.

On the financial side, the situation remains tense. Ubisoft's stock has reached its lowest historical level, and the company is seeking to cut costs by 200 million euros. According to Jean-Marc Tableur, financial analyst at Deloitte Gaming, "Ubisoft is in a delicate position where even a good game is no longer enough. They could release the best Assassin's Creed in history, and investors would still ask why it's not a mobile game with lootboxes."

Tencent has reportedly expressed interest in an acquisition. A Ubisoft executive, when asked about this possibility, allegedly responded: "We remain open to any discussions that would allow us to continue delaying games peacefully." The Claws of Awaji DLC, released in September, added 10 hours of content. One player calculated that this represents "less time than the cumulative delays".
